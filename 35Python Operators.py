# Python Operators
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

# Example
print(10 + 5)

# Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or two variables:

# Example
sum1 = 100 + 50      # 150 (100 + 50)
sum2 = sum1 + 250    # 400 (150 + 250)
sum3 = sum2 + sum2   # 800 (400 + 400)

# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators
