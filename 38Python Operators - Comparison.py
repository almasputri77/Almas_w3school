# Comparison Operators
# Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

# Operator	    Name	                    Example	
# ==	        Equal	                    x == y	
# !=	        Not equal	                x != y	
# >	            Greater than	            x > y	
# <	            Less than	                x < y	
# >=	        Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
# <=	        Less than or equal to	    x <= y

# Examples
# Comparison operators return True or False based on the comparison:

# Example
x = 5
y = 3

print(x == y)
print(x != y)
print(x > y)
print(x < y)
print(x >= y)
print(x <= y)

# Chaining Comparison Operators
# Python allows you to chain comparison operators:

# Example
x = 5

print(1 < x < 10)

print(1 < x and x < 10)
