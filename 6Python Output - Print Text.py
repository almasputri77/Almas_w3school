# Print Text
# You can use the print() function as many times as you want. Each call prints text on a new line by default:
print("Hello World!")
print("I am learning Python.")
print("It is awesome!")

# Double Quotes
# Text in Python must be inside quotes. 
# You can use either " double quotes or ' single quotes:

print("This will work!")
print('This will also work!')

# Print Without a New Line
# By default, the print() function ends with a new line.
# If you want to print multiple words on the same line, you can use the end parameter:

print("Hello World!", end=" ")
print("I will print on the same line.")
