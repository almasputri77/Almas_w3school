# Operator Precedence
# Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed.

# Example
# Parentheses has the highest precedence, meaning that expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated first:
print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))

# Example
# Multiplication * has higher precedence than addition +, and therefore multiplications are evaluated before additions:

print(100 + 5 * 3)

# Precedence Order
# The precedence order is described in the table below, starting with the highest precedence at the top:

# Operator	            Description	
# ()	                Parentheses	
# **	                Exponentiation	
# +x  -x  ~x	        Unary plus, unary minus, and bitwise NOT	
# *  /  //  %	        Multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus	
# +  -	                Addition and subtraction	
# <<  >>	            Bitwise left and right shifts	
# &	                    Bitwise AND	
# ^	                    Bitwise XOR	
# |	                    Bitwise OR	
# ==  !=  >  >=  <  <=  
# is  is not  in  not in 	Comparisons, identity, and membership operators	
# not	                Logical NOT	
# and	                AND	
# or	                OR

# Left-to-Right Evaluation
# If two operators have the same precedence, the expression is evaluated from left to right.

# Example
# Addition + and subtraction - has the same precedence, and therefore we evaluate the expression from left to right:

print(5 + 4 - 7 + 3)
