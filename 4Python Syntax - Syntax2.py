#Python Variables
#In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:

x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"

print (x)
print (y)

#Comments
#Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.
#Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")
