#P rint Numbers
# You can also use the print() function to display numbers:
# However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes:

print(3)
print(358)
print(50000)

# You can also do math inside the print() function:
print(3 + 3)
print(2 * 5)

#You can combine text and numbers in one output by separating them with a comma:
print("I am", 35, "years old.")
