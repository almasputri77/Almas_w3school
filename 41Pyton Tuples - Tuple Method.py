# Tuple Methods
# Python has two built-in methods that you can use on tuples.

# Method	Description
# count()	Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
# index()	Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found

angka = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5)
print(angka.count(2))

buah = ("apel", "pisang", "ceri", "pisang")
print(buah.index("pisang"))
