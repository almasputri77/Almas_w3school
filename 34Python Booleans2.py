# Most Values are True
# Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.

# Any string is True, except empty strings.

# Any number is True, except 0.

# Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.

# Example
# The following will return True:

bool("abc")
bool(123)
bool(["apple", "cherry", "banana"])

# Some Values are False
# In fact, there are not many values that evaluate to False, 
# except empty values, such as (), [], {}, "", the number 0, and the value None. 
# And of course the value False evaluates to False.

# Example
# The following will return False:

bool(False)
bool(None)
bool(0)
bool("")
bool(())
bool([])
bool({})

#One more value, or object in this case, evaluates to False, 
# and that is if you have an object that is made from a class with a __len__ function 
# that returns 0 or False:

# Example
class myclass():
  def __len__(self):
    return 0

myobj = myclass()
print(bool(myobj))

# Functions can Return a Boolean
# You can create functions that returns a Boolean Value:

# Example
# Print the answer of a function:

def myFunction() :
  return True

print(myFunction())

# You can execute code based on the Boolean answer of a function:
# Example
# Print "YES!" if the function returns True, otherwise print "NO!":
def myFunction() :
  return True

if myFunction():
  print("YES!")
else:
  print("NO!")

# Python also has many built-in functions that return a boolean value, 
# like the isinstance() function, which can be used to determine if an object is of a certain data type:
# Example
# Check if an object is an integer or not:

x = 200
print(isinstance(x, int))
